Plans
=====

Modes
-----

Currently, there's two modes to display the graph: Python's WxWidgets interface and a web interface.
There's a high potential to get more information out of the dataset by expanding available modes.

Community detection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I should try several community detection [#f1]_ [#f2]_ methods.

Adjacency graph
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A mode for an adjacency graph will require a bit more work, for example,
exporting only a top N tags and limit tag lengths so everything can be displayed.

* `NetworkX <https://networkx.org/>`_: `Reading and writing graphs Â» JSON <https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/readwrite/json_graph.html>`_

Word2Vec
^^^^^^^^

I am not sure if it can be used as-is, but there were some works that remind me it can be useful to try later. [#f3]_

Experiments
-----------

Edge weighting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Edge weights in pair_mgr are currently divided by an "edge_count" parameter.
I am not sure it is an ideal option that allows to see the maximum amount of details.

Weighting by relation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Will add edges between tags like "Abstract style" and "Abstract" add more context?
* How to weight those edges properly?

Argparse
--------

* Save contents for tag_manager and pair_manager
